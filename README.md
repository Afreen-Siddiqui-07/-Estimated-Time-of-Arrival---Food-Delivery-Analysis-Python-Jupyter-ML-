# Estimated Time of Arrival - Food Delivery ML Project 🍽️

## 📌 Description
This machine learning project predicts the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for food deliveries. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and training ML models to estimate delivery times based on real-world factors.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle or simulated dataset
- Fields: Order ID, Delivery Distance, Weather, Traffic Density, Vehicle Type, Order Time, Delivery Time

## 📈 Key Features
- In-depth EDA and visualization of delivery trends
- Feature importance and correlation heatmaps
- ML Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree
- ETA predictions for new delivery inputs

## 📸 Visualizations
> *(Include pair plots, correlation matrix, prediction result plots)*

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook ETA_Prediction.ipynb`

## ✅ Results
- Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy (~85%)
- Traffic density and vehicle type are major influencers of ETA
